###ABSTRACT
The floating action button (FAB) was popularized by the release of Googleâ€™s Material Design principles in 2014. Since this release, the FAB user interface component has been widely adopted in web and mobile design. However, the effectiveness of the FAB has been a controversial topic in the user experience design community. Albeit, there is no research based evidence validating user experience implications of the FAB. This study addresses the user experience implications of the FAB. Usability data was generated by employing industry standard A/B user testing methods performed on both the FAB and a traditional action button as a control. Comparison analysis of this data exhibited that the FAB component presented a slight negative usability impact upon users first use of the button. However, after having used the FAB, users repeated the action and the data demonstrated the FAB was more efficient. Once users had successfully completed a task using the FAB, they were able to use it more efficiently than the traditional action button.

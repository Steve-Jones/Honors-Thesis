##PURPOSE
The Floating Action Button (FAB) was popularized by the release of Googleâ€™s Material Design principles in 2014. Since this release, the prominent FAB user interface component has been widely adopted in web and mobile design. However, the effectiveness of the FAB has been a controversial topic in the user experience design community. Albeit, there is no research based evidence validating user experience implications of the FAB.

##METHODS
This study addresses the user experience implications of the FAB. This is done by building two nearly identical native iOS applications. The only difference is that one application implements the FAB to achieve an action, whereas the other implements a classic user interface component to achieve this same action. Employing industry standard user experience testing methods based on Nielsen Norman Group quantitative usability approaches, generates usability data. Comparison analysis of the data generated from each application exhibits the user experience implications of the FAB component.
